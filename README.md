Basic UI automation test with Cypress

```shellscript
$ git --version

- Verify that you have `Node.js` installed
```shellscript
$ node -v
```
For Node.js if you do not return, for example, a value similar or superior to `v18.12.1` or if your terminal does not recognize the command, we recommend installing Node as detailed in the official

Node.js installers include the npm command line utility, verify that everything was installed correctly executing the following commands in the console
```shellscript
$ node -v
```
```shellscript
$ npm -v
```
## Use sample project locally
- Clone the repository and move inside that path:
```shellscript
$ git clone git@github.com:eataborda/ui-cypress.git
$ cd ./ui-cypress
```
- Install the project dependencies using npm:
```shellscript
$ npm install
```
This creates the node_modules folder with everything needed to be able to run the automated tests

## Run tests
